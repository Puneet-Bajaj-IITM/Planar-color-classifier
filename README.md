# Planar Color Classifier

The Planar Color Classifier is a Python-based tool that enables efficient classification of data points within a two-dimensional dataset based on color information. This README provides essential information about how to use and understand the classifier.

## Dependencies

To use the Planar Color Classifier, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciKit-Learn
- h5py (for handling HDF5 datasets)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn h5py
```

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure that your dataset is in HDF5 format. You can create or convert datasets to this format using the h5py library.

2. **Classifier Implementation**: The classifier is implemented in a Python script. Import it into your project and instantiate an instance of the classifier.

3. **Training**: Use your prepared dataset to train the classifier. The training process will involve extracting color features from the dataset and labeling data points according to your classification task.

4. **Classification**: After training, you can use the classifier to predict the category of new data points based on their color features.

5. **Visualization**: The classifier includes visualization tools using Matplotlib to help you visualize the classification results and assess the model's performance.
